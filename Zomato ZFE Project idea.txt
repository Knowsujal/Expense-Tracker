Zomato ZFE Project idea

Basic idea - design for companies to solve FOOD EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.

Requirements - 

1. To add no. of employees.
2. To set budget provided to each department/employees.
3. Maintaining rules and policies of the company regarding the approval or rejection of food expenses.

Context :-

The Webpage helps the executive (for eg, Manager) to manage the food expense (i.e, how much the company will spend on their employees for food). 
It gives control to the executive to have a track on the expenses and to be able to approve or reject the order.
The employees will order the food and the money will be directly deducted from the companies budget that prevent reimbursement process.

Project Task :-

Details includes -
1. Name, no. of employees registered in the system.
2. Order Id and details are stored with the employee name assigned with it.
3. Manager will be notified if the expense crosses or doesn't match the rules of policy of the company.

Working Idea -
 The page is designed as per the manager or the higher executive that will control all the expenses that might include-

i) Employee register themselves on the site and they use that interface to order and the bill is saved in the system and payment is done by the company.
ii) The manager that controls the expense system will be notified if the expense got cross or any policy has been broken.
iii) The manager got to choose whether he/she has to approve the order or not by clicking button "Approved" or "Disapproved".
